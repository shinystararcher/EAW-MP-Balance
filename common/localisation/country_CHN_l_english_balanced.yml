However, with the flaws of pre-war doctrine becoming apparent and in the face of Stalliongradian T-34 tanks, the Panzer IV soon assumed the tank-fighting role of its increasingly obsolete cousin.

It was intended as a counter to the Stalliongradian T-34, and as a replacement for the Panzer III and Panzer IV. While never replacing the latter, it served alongside the heavier Tiger tank. The Panther's excellent combination of firepower, mobility, and protection served as a benchmark for other nations' late war and post-war tank designs, and it is regarded as one of the best tanks every created."

bal_CHN_Naval_Bomber:0 "Torpedo Bombers"
bal_CHN_Naval_Bomber_desc:0 "Naval Torpedo Bombers, when used properly, have the potential to not only sink a ship, but sink an entire hostile fleet. Ensuring we've got the best naval fighters will give us a great advantage."

bal_CHN_Carriers:0 "Modern Carrier Designs"
bal_CHN_Carriers_desc:0 "Bigger carriers with more deck space is the omega, the end, of the carrier development. Such a ship would be the epitome of naval warfare."
bal_CHN_Heavy_Cruisers:0 "Heavy Cruiser Designs"
bal_CHN_Heavy_Cruisers_desc:0 "Battleships, while no doubt impressive, still need support from their smaller sisters. Heavy cruisers not only provide anti-air support, but also bring main armament to match the might of the battleship."
bal_CHN_Battlecruisers:0 "Battlecruisers Designs"
bal_CHN_Battlecruisers_desc:0 "Even with the impressive combination of firepower from both heavy cruisers and battleships, there still needs to be something in the middle to fill the place of either of the other two if they are otherwise unavailable. A Battlecruiser."
bal_CHN_Battleships:0 "Battleship Designs"
bal_CHN_Battleships_desc:0 "The final form of the battleship is the image most imagine. Heavy armour, huge guns, and with enough size to send any lesser enemy retreating back to their home port."
bal_CHN_Marine_Operations:0 "Marine Tactics"
bal_CHN_Marine_Operations_desc:0 "The development of amphibious troops designed to attack enemies where no land path is possible is something that should be focused on, as the advantage it would deliver is beyond immeasurable."

Among other stipulations it specifies that the Changelings shall have no independent military, all troops shall be under the direct command of the Equestrian generalship, and that their justice system and paramilitary forces will have to take orders from Equestrian advisors hoof selected by Canterlot for their moral character and bureaucratic acumen. It is hoped that these conditions, among others, will prevent another war from ever occurring. However, even now there are those in Canterlot itself who say that this peace treaty will only be remembered the prelude to an even grander and more deadly conflict."

In the letter he claims that the Changelings and all other creatures living in the northern land could be a great asset to Equestria in their war if they were finally given an independent military organization again. The letter was met by mixed feelings by the general staff. Some claim that giving the Changelings their own command is just asking for the horrors of the Great War to repeat themselves, but this time on a second front. Others say that the general staff is already overworked managing all of Equestria's divisions, armies, army groups, and theaters, and that [From.GetNameDef] taking over some of the load would be a good help."

bal_changelingattache.1.d:0 "’Because of internal matters within the Changeling Lands the scientists, soldiers, advisors, and all related personnel of the Changeling-Griffonian Expeditionary Mission are hereby ordered to return home at once by the decree of Queen Chrysalis.’\nThe message is simple, written in a taciturn dialect of the language the two distant nations share, yet profound in its meaning. For years the changelings assisting the Imperial Army and attached research divisions have become a staple of life for those in the upper echelons of the command hierarchy, and now it is time for them to leave. The mood is unsurprisingly somber when the message is read aloud, both for what leaving means and for what awaits the changelings in their homeland.\nSynovial, senior military commander of the mission, seems relieved at the news, as if a great weight had been lifted off his wings. His compatriot, Thranx, seems to have had the opposite reaction, falling into a depressive stupor that in turn lowers the mood of all those near him. The differing reactions have prompted one of the Imperial commanders who worked with the CGEM to voice the idea that they should throw a party for all the members of the mission to wish them fond farewells, for it would seem to be kind to let their last memories of the Griffonian Empire be happy ones."

There are hundreds of them, and hundreds more griffons that seek to attend the party as well. Luckily for all those involved, when the capital was first moved from Griffonstone to Griffenheim the designers of the new Imperial Palace’s grand ballroom had capacity first in mind.\n\nThe party ends up lasting well into the early dawn hours, with many an event to be seen. Scientists exchanged last minute notes while reminiscing about strange discoveries. A griffon noblewoman actually managed to impersonate a changeling colonel, and soldiers of both species broke out into song over large flaggons of beer. Fun was had by all, and somecreature was even able to get Thranx to smile again.\n\nDuring the party though it seems that the young emperor snuck in, and overheard Imperial Army soldiers wishing their Changeling Lander friends that they could help them out or even fight alongside them in whatever struggle awaited them back home. This would lead to a review of supplies and troop strength in the morrow. Theoretically, the proposal could be done, but it also could just be written off as an alcohol-induced hallucination.\n\nIn any case, this night will long be remembered as the rowdiest party in memory, and a true bright spot on the record of Imperial affairs."

Their 'empire' had already been torn apart by their own minions, and their decadence and incompetence even today does not cease to amaze me. If they so valiantly refuse my orders and demands, then they must be entirely unaware of who they've just made an enemy with.

bal_changelingattache.10.d:0 "It all appeared to be a perfectly normal day, today. For the most part.\n\nGeneral Thranx had used the time in Griffonia and away from other changelings to better incorporate himself into the life of a griffon. Often times he had used his shapeshifting abilities to 'fit in', but many griffons, especially those who had previously worked with him, respected and liked him either way, no matter the appearance.\nThranx has even gone so far as finding a lover that lived just outside of the capital. It was all too perfect, it seemed, and the lone Changeling appeared to be in good claws.\n\nThat was nothing but a ruse though, it seems. Earlier today, during a visit at a restaurant, Thranx began to cough heavily, and shortly after collapsed to the ground. Griffons nearby immediately rushed to his rescue, seeing him cough up blood, but it was no use. General Thranx... died.\n\nA funeral has already been organised for this brave changeling, and he has been issued  griffonian citizenship post-mortem to thank him for the appreciation he shared for our nation and culture.\n\nShockingly though, police has found out that the cause of Thranx death was a deadly poison, one that has never been seen or used in all of Griffonia before. In addition, his fiancée is nowhere to be found following his death. Could this be the work of a fellow changeling, sent by Chrysalis? For now, we are unsure."

So much, in fact, that he tried to seek out a lover. Our infiltrator used this opportunity to charm and get near him, and later poisoned his drink while they were eating at a restaurant. The infiltrator managed to flee the scene before anyone could catch onto him."

Before she could reply though, Trimmel publicly thanked the volunteers and assigned them positions in the Army. Chrysalis is furious at this, and said that if harmony grows it will be Trimmel’s fault, but otherwise made no moves against it."
