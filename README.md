Balance changes for Equestria At War Multiplayer

This Project seeks to make the Multiplayer experience for Equestria At War more fun by adjusting countries to better compete in multiplayer without being overwhemed by bad events or a vastly superior opponent

It requires the Equestria at war mod and the base game of Hearts of Iron 4. 


Install the mod from the steam workshop page located at https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1713746266&searchtext=z-EAW
